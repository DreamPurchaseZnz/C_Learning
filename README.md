## Compiler

Computers understand only one language and that language consists of sets of instructions made of ones and zeros. This computer language is appropriately called machine language.

Because a computer can only understand *machine language* and humans wish to write in *high level languages* and high level languages have to be re-written (translated) into machine language at some point. 

This is done by special programs called *compilers*, interpreters, or assemblers that are built into the various programming applications.

## Console programs
Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

 An IDE generally integrates several development tools, including *a text editor* and *tools to compile programs directly from it*.
